# ZIMOBI APP

* Test in Ruby On Rails
  
Here's the practice test I commented:
A Zimobi consults develop a new product (front end and back end), Zimouber Sales, and you have been chosen to create the MVP of this project.
At Zimouber Sales, anyone can create an ad for their property for sale. A single technical technique and product are created in Rails. An ad consists of:

A title
A description
An image
A sale value
The story to be worked out:


As a property owner for sale on Zimouber sale, I want to be able to create, edit and view my ads.


*Technologies used:

 Test: faker, rspec, capybara, databaseclear
 CSS: sas
 Database: Sqlite
